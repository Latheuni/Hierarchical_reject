**multiclass.py** cointains the necessary functions to implement hierarchical annotation with a specified classifier that gets trained in every node of a pre-defined hierarchy. The (sub)labels in the hierarchy need to be inputted with ';' separating them so that the hierarchy can get constructed.


This code was mostly written by Thomas Mortier and slightly adapted by Lauren Theunissen.
