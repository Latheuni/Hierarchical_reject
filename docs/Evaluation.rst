Evaluation of the rejection processes
=====================================
The following functions output all the necessary datapoints to plot accuracy-rejection curves for evaluation of (partial) rejection.
For Rejection with hierarchiczl classification a splitted option and parallelised function are available as prediction over a lot of thresholds can sometimes take quite a lot of time.
