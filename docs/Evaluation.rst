Evaluation of the rejection processes
=====================================
The following functions output all the necessary datapoints to plot accuracy-rejection curves for evaluation of (partial) rejection.
For rejection with hierarchical classification a parallelised function is available as prediction over a lot of thresholds can sometimes take quite a lot of time.
